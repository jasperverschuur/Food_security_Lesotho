# Food security Lesotho

This repository let you reproduce the analysis done in the article 'Climate change as a driver of food insecurity in the 2007 Lesotho-South Africa drought' - Verschuur, Li, Wolski and Otto (under review).

The folder 'Climate_bivariate_data' contains all the scripts and data to reproduce the plots in Figure 2 of the article. This results in the shift of the bivariate empirical distribution function of the compound drought in four ensemble climate models: HadGEM3-A, weather@home, ETH-CAM4, MIROC5.

The folder 'probabilistic_model' contains all scripts and data to reproduce the analysis to derive the plots in Figure 3 of the article. The probabililistic model is used to derive the food insecurity proxies in Lesotho in the actual world (ACT) and counterfactual world without climate change (NAT). The output files, container food shortages, maize prices and value of imported maize are saved in dataframes in the 'output_L_SA' folder.
